* You can include links using standard Markdown syntax: [Link Text](https://www.example.com).
* You can add images by referencing them in the content directory: ![Image alt text](image.jpg).

**Optional sections:**

* **Related Terms:** You can list related terms at the end of the definition:

  Related Terms:

  * [Term 2](term2.html)

* **Additional Notes:** You can include any additional notes or explanations for the term.

Explanation:
* Front Matter (YAML):
  * The first part (between --- lines) is the front matter written in YAML format.
  * It includes the title of the term, which will be used for the page title and displayed in the glossary index.
* Markdown Content:
  * The rest of the file is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language for formatting text.
  * The template provides examples of using bullet points, emphasis, links, and images.
* Optional Sections:
  * You can include additional sections like "Related Terms" and "Additional Notes" to provide more context and information for the term.
Remember to:
* Replace Term Name with the actual term name for each file.
* Create the corresponding .md file for each term in the content directory.
* Update the image path and alt text if you're including images.
