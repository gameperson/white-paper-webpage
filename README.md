# White Paper Website

This website serves as a repository for white papers on various topics related to [your field of interest]. 

## Folder Structure

The project uses the following folder structure:

* **white-paper-topic1:** This folder contains the content for the first white paper on topic 1.
    * `paper.md`: This file stores the white paper content in Markdown format.
    * `references.txt`: This file contains the list of references for the white paper.
    * `glossary.txt`: This file defines any glossary terms used in the white paper.
* **white-paper-topic2:** Similar structure for additional white papers.
* **README.md:** This file (you're currently reading it!).
* **index.html:** This file serves as the main landing page for the website (we'll create this later).
* **build.js** (Optional): This script automates the website generation process (we'll create this later).

## Contributing (Optional)

If you'd like to contribute a white paper to this website, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new subfolder named `white-paper-<your-topic>`, where `<your-topic>` represents the subject of your white paper.
2. Inside the subfolder, create the following files:
    * `paper.md`: Add your white paper content in Markdown format.
    * `references.txt`: List your references for the white paper.
    * `glossary.txt` (Optional): Define any glossary terms used in the white paper.

## Building the Website (Optional)

This section will be added later to explain how to run the build script (if you choose to use one) to generate the final website files.

We'll keep adding details to this README as we progress with the website development.
