# White Paper Website

This repository hosts a collection of white papers on various topics.

**Features:**

* **Automated Build:** Utilizes a Node.js script to automatically generate HTML pages from Markdown files, references, and glossaries.
* **Dynamic Indexing:** The main `index.html` file automatically generates a list of all available white papers.
* **Modular Structure:** White papers are organized in subfolders (e.g., `white-paper-topic1`) for better organization and maintainability.
